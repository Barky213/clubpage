## Overview

A website for an imaginary club based on a challenge on Codeacademy.com.
The aim is to put into practice what we have learned about responsive websites and other CSS and semantic HTML.

## My process

I first started by simply laying out the structure with HTML. I did it by focussing individually on each section until finished. Then reread the code to check for errors.
After HTML, I followed a similar procedure on CSS for the styling. First I concentrated on the header, then followed the page down section by section, onlymoving on when each section was finished. Occasionally tweaking previous sections if they didn't look as good together as I imagined. After completing the styling for desktop, I progressed with changes via media queries based on different break points.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project helped to clear up some confusion I had had with how CSS grid positions each item and how it is possible to change the order of items. I also got a clearer idea of some of the basic requirements for smaller screen sizes and how to change the site for them.

### Continued development

I want to continue to practise using CSS grid as I feel it can be very useful. I also feel that I can make my process of making a site responsive more efficient


### Useful resources

- Wes Bos' free CSS Grid Course (https://wesbos.com/) - This helped me understand CSS grid a little more and gave clear examples of the different uses.
